# 📊 Dashboard Design Blueprint

This file outlines proposed visual modules for analyzing maize yield data across East Africa. It supports the data pipeline by giving structure to exploratory and operational dashboards.

---

## 🌾 1. Yield Overview
- Total dry weight over time
- Region-wise yield comparison
- Trend analysis by year and season

## ⚖️ 2. Input vs Output
- Fertilizer use vs yield efficiency
- Cost-benefit ratio by field
- Scatter plots showing input vs dry weight

## 🗺️ 3. Geospatial Yield Map
- Plot locations from GPS metadata
- STAC footprint overlays
- Heatmap showing yield density by location

## 🍂 4. Seasonal Performance
- Yield variation across seasons
- Time-aligned satellite imagery
- Rainfall/yield correlation if available

## 🧭 5. Field Summary Explorer
- Interactive filters by field ID, country, or planting date
- Summary cards with dry weight, inputs, imagery timestamps
- Exportable insights for agronomic teams
